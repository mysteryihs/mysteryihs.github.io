            If you were like me, you used the same password for all of your accounts because you can't be bothered to memorize or write down a bunch of different passwords. You probably think why does it matter? I never get hacked.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you said that to me in person, my response would be: "You haven't been hacked <i>yet.</i>" Companies get hacked and leak data all the time, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_data_breaches">even the big ones</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            For those who don't know what a password manager is; it's a software that manages all the credentials you need to login to a site allowing you to keep track of all unique and hard to crack passwords while only having to remember one password.
            This is all dependent on the fact that <i><b>you pick and use a master password that you have never used before and will never reveal or write down.</b></i> If you stick with a password manager, it should be the last password you'll ever need to remember.
        </p>
        <p>
            I'll admit though, if you rarely use the internet past the typical big companies like Facebook and Google then the use of a password manager might not be necessary, but for the vast majority a password manager is something I highly recommend. Allow me to illustrate.

            Lets say Google gets hacked or has its data leaked. You obviously have to change your password for Google and because hackers are smart enough to try your email/password on other websites you have to change the other sites too.
            Luckily you only use Facebook and Amazon so you change the password to those two accounts and you're perfectly okay.
        </p>

            Now with more accounts sharing the same password things start to become complicated. If one company gets hacked, you have to change the password of every account in order to make sure all accounts are secure. 
            Most likely you're going to have a lot more accounts on a lot more websites. Imagine if you had 20 logins with the same password. Imagine if you had 100 accounts. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Not only would it be an incredible pain to change 100 passwords, each added account increases the chances of your password being compromised. 
            If you also consider that some of the lesser known websites have worse security than Google or Facebook then your chances of being hacked increase tremendously.

            Here is an illustration of a password manager at work. As you can see, the password manager forms a layer of protection from your other passwords so that if one website becomes compromised then your other passwords (including your master password) are safe.
            The only real risk here is if the password manager itself gets hacked. But with a few simple practices, a password manager is reliably secure.
        </p>
        <p>
            While I've spent a good chunk of this article praising password managers, speaking from experience I have to admit there are some definite inconveniences to using password managers in addition to its benefits.
        </p>
        <p>
            <h2>Pros</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Being able to secure your login credentials while remembering only one password.</li>
                <li>Protecting your other accounts if one website gets hacked.</li>
                <li>Being able to store notes relating to your logins like PIN numbers and DOB.</li>
                <li>Auto fill login credentials is a thing.</li>
                <li>Able to download the password data and store it offline.</li>
                <li>Did I mention using stronger passwords with one memorized password?</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            <h2>Cons</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>If you didn't start off using a password manager, you have to change and store all the passwords manually. Some password managers can automate this, but it's unreliable.</li>
                <li>Sharing and typing passwords is a real pain. If you're not able to copy and paste, you have to type the unique password in manually and with randomized string of characters that can be incredibly annoying.</li>
                <li>If you're logging in through a phone or computer that's not yours, there are more hoops you have to go through to get your password. You have to download the app or login to the password manager through the website.</li>
                <li>If you forget your master password (which you really shouldn't), then all your passwords are lost and you have to reset them all. There's no other way to recover your password vault without your master password.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            For the average user, a password manager will greatly improve your internet-using life. While it's not a revolutionary change to how we use the internet, if you take the time to set it up it will only benefit you from there on out.
